            <h1>Impact of Technology</h1>
            <p>
               As Psychology Today says, “There is a little doubt that all of the new technologies, led by the Internet and digital technology, are shaping the way we think in ways obvious and subtle, deliberate and unintentional, and advantageous and detrimental.”* While research into this field is still in its infancy and there are no scientifically agreed-upon conclusions, there are several areas where modern digital technology is certainly affecting the way we interact with the world and the way our children’s brains develop.
               Technology can be a scary thing, especially for businesses that have found success doing things a certain way and are wary of changing their ways. Technology is also advancing at a rapid pace and sudden change is something that many people in general aren’t comfortable with. However, if you don’t keep up with new technology, you risk losing ground to your competition.
               To put your mind at ease, remind yourself that technology has always advanced with the purpose of making our lives better. Also remember that all technology was new at one point in time. Those who were open to new technology have been more likely to benefit from it. So keep an open mind when new technology comes out or as current technologies continue to evolve. We have compiled a few examples of how technology has changed our lives in a positive way over the course of history. In the last few decades, technology has progressed at a staggering rate. Smartphones, the internet, cloud computing, and hundreds of other inventions are changing every facet of our lives. Communication, business, government, travel, fundraising, and even agriculture have been affected. But how about our brains Is all this new technology changing us on the inside Many think so, including psychology professionals.

               Social media and mobile devices may lead to psychological and physical issues, such as eyestrain and difficulty focusing on important tasks. They may also contribute to more serious health conditions, such as depression. The overuse of technology may have a more significant impact on developing children and teenagers. The advent of COVID-19 arose the need for social distancing measures, including the imposition of far-reaching lockdowns in many countries. The lockdown has wreaked havoc on many aspects of daily life, but education has been particularly hard hit by this unprecedented situation. The closure of educational institutions brought along many changes, including the transition to more technology-based education. This is a systematic literature review that seeks to explore the transition, in the context of the pandemic, from traditional education that involves face-to-face interaction in physical classrooms to online distance education. It examines the ways in which this transition has impacted academia and students and looks at the potential long-term consequences it may have caused. It also presents some of the suggestions made by the studies included in the paper, which may help alleviate the negative impact of lockdown on education and promote a smoother transition to online learning.  
               One of the major technology is affecting lives by causing sleeping disorders like interrupted sleep, no sleep at all etc. Need is to correct your sleep cycle to have a good night's, uninterrupted sleep, every day. Make your sleeping place calm, free from gadgets. To Avoid stress in life due to technology, try to make things oragnized. Start with buying a planner making a scedule that works for you. Like what time you should be doing what, for how many hours, what time you should get to the bed, etc. Being conscious about using the better aspects of technology so that we are not getting affected adversely is something we need to focus on. It is important to realize that this is a tool to make the lives better and not otherwise.
